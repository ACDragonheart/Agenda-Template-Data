530 SANSOME STREET –east side between Washington and Merchant Streets; Lots 013, 014, and 017 in Assessor’s Block 0206 (District 3) – Discussion and possible Joint Action by the Planning Commission and the Recreation and Park Commission to raise the absolute cumulative limit for Maritime Plaza and set an absolute cumulative limit for Sue Bierman Park, pursuant to the jointly-approved Planning Code Section 295 Implementation Memo adopted in 1989, in order to accommodate new shadow cast by the proposed project at 530 Sansome Street. The proposed project (“Project”) includes the demolition of three existing buildings, including San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) Station 13 and two vacant commercial buildings and the construction of a new mixed-use building reaching a roof height up to 218 feet tall (236’ inclusive of rooftop screening/mechanical equipment). The Project proposes two distinct development programs that could be implemented, one that would construct various commercial uses further described below (“Commercial Variant”) and one that would construct residential uses further described below (“Residential Variant”). Both the Commercial Variant and Residential Variant would include construction of a state-of-the-art, four-story Fire Station 13 (approximately 21,000 square feet of gross floor area with minor variations in square footage between the Commercial Variant and Residential Variant), as well as a below-grade, non-accessory private parking garage for the SFFD containing 18 spaces (approximately 7,800 square feet of gross floor area with minor variations in square footage between the Commercial Variant and Residential Variant). The Commercial Variant would include a total of approximately 249,000 square feet of gross floor area, including the Fire Department uses, as well as various commercial uses contained in a 19-story tower, including approximately 141,000 square feet of hotel uses (200 rooms), approximately 37,100 square feet of office uses, approximately 32,000 square feet of gym uses and approximately 7,900 square feet of restaurant uses. The Commercial Variant proposes 22 Class 1 and 26 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces, three (3) off-street loading spaces, as well as 30 parking spaces and one (1) car-share below-grade parking spaces for the non-Fire Department uses. The Residential Variant would include a total of approximately 283,000 square feet of gross floor area, including the Fire Department uses, as well as approximately 247,000 square feet of residential uses (256 dwelling units) in a 21-story tower. The additional two building stories in the Residential Variant are the result of slightly smaller floor-to-floor ceiling heights for the residential floors. The Residential Variant proposes 143 Class 1 and 21 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces, three (3) off-street loading spaces, as well as 64 parking spaces and two (2) car-share below-grade parking spaces for the residential uses. The Residential Variant would contain a mix of 191 studio and one-bedroom units, 38 two-bedroom units, and 27 three-bedroom units. For both the Commercial Variant and Residential Variant, SFFD proposes changes to the lane configuration and traffic light facilities on Washington Street, such that SFFD engines would be able to safely make westbound and eastbound turns out to Washington Street to enhance SFFD’s ability to promptly respond to emergency calls. The Project Site is located within a C-3-O (Downtown Office) Zoning District, Downtown Plan Area, and 200-S Height and Bulk District.
